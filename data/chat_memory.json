    "text": "The answer lies in the fact that the initial payment of \u20b9300 was split equally among the three friends, making each friend pay \u20b9100.\n\nLater, the guests received an additional \u20b950 from the hotel manager, which they divided equally among themselves, resulting in each guest paying \u20b990 (\u20b9100 - \u20b910).\n\nHowever, the question states that \"Now each guest has paid \u20b990\", implying that this amount is what each guest initially had before receiving the refund. Since each guest originally paid \u20b9100 and received a refund of \u20b910, it means that each guest had \u20b990 to begin with.\n\nThe confusion arises from the fact that the guests' initial payment of \u20b9300 was split into three parts of \u20b9100 each, but when they received the additional \u20b950, it was not split among them. Instead, it was given directly to each guest as a refund.\n\nTo calculate the total amount paid by the guests, we add up their individual payments: \u20b990 + \u20b990 + \u20b990 = \u20b9270.\n\nThe missing \u20b910 refers to the original payment of \u20b9300 minus the correct total amount paid by the guests (\u20b9270). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n$300 - 270 = \u20b930"

    "text": "The question you're asking is related to G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorems and the concept of \"stronger\" formal systems.\n\nG\u00f6del's First Incompleteness Theorem states that any sufficiently powerful formal system (i.e., a system with enough axioms and rules of inference) will either be incomplete or inconsistent. This means that there are statements about arithmetic that cannot be proved or disproved within the system, and therefore the system is either incomplete (not all truths can be proved) or inconsistent (leads to contradictions).\n\nRegarding your question, the short answer is: it's a complex and open problem in mathematical logic.\n\nThere are a few approaches that have been explored:\n\n1. **Finitistic systems**: Some researchers have investigated formal systems with a limited number of axioms or a finite size, which might avoid the incompleteness issues. However, even in these cases, some theorems about arithmetic may still be undecidable.\n2. **Tarski's Hierarchy**: In 1936, Alfred Tarski introduced a hierarchy of formal systems, each with an increasing number of axioms and rules. The higher systems might provide more comprehensive results, but this approach also raises questions about consistency.\n3. **Non-standard models**: Some researchers have explored non-standard models of arithmetic, which are mathematical structures that deviate from the standard Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms. These models might be more complete than the standard arithmetic, but they can still lead to paradoxes and inconsistencies.\n\nOne example of a formal system that is often mentioned in this context is **Von Neumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del set theory (NBG)**, which has been shown to have some interesting properties. NBG is an extension of ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms with the Axiom of Choice) and has a more complex structure than standard arithmetic.\n\nHowever, even in these systems, it's still unclear whether all truths about arithmetic can be proved without leading to contradiction. The question remains open, and mathematicians continue to explore new approaches to formalize mathematics.\n\nIn summary, while there are some interesting approaches to formalizing arithmetic, the problem of creating a system that is stronger than arithmetic (i.e., where all truths about arithmetic are provable) without leading to contradiction remains an open challenge in mathematical logic."

    "text": "One of the most famous open problems in mathematics and logic!\n\nThe question you're asking is related to the concept of \"aristotelian\" or \"non-axiomatic\" systems. According to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem, any formal system powerful enough to describe basic arithmetic (e.g., Peano axioms) will necessarily be incomplete, meaning there are statements about arithmetic that cannot be proved within the system.\n\nHowever, some mathematicians and logicians have explored the idea of more robust systems that might be able to capture the truth about arithmetic without leading to contradictions. These ideas include:\n\n1. **Higher-order logic**: This involves extending classical logic to allow for quantification over logical formulas themselves, rather than just individual propositions. Higher-order logic can potentially capture more complex relationships between statements and avoid the incompleteness problem.\n2. **Fuzzy logic**: Fuzzy logic is a mathematical approach that allows for degrees of truth rather than strict binary values (true/false). This might provide a way to formalize the truth about arithmetic in a way that avoids contradictions, but it's still an open question whether such a system could be complete and consistent.\n3. **Categorical foundations**: Some researchers have explored using category theory, a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between mathematical structures, as a foundation for mathematics. Category theory might provide a more abstract framework for understanding arithmetic, potentially allowing for a more complete and consistent description of its truth.\n\nOne notable example of a system that aims to capture the truth about arithmetic without leading to contradictions is **Cayley-Dickson doubles** (also known as \"complex numbers\" in some contexts). These are mathematical structures that allow us to extend certain mathematical operations to higher-dimensional spaces, potentially providing a more complete and consistent framework for arithmetic.\n\nHowever, even if such systems exist or can be developed, it's essential to note that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem is still widely considered to be one of the most profound results in mathematics, and any attempt to develop stronger systems would require significant advancements in our understanding of logic, mathematics, and the nature of truth itself.\n\nIn summary, while there are ongoing efforts to explore more robust systems for capturing the truth about arithmetic without leading to contradictions, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem remains a fundamental challenge that continues to shape the development of mathematical foundations."
